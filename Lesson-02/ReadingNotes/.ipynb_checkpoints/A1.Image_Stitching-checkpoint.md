[Feature Matching + Homography to find Objects](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_feature_homography/py_feature_homography.html?highlight=cv2%20findhomography)


- Step #1: Detect keypoints (DoG, Harris, etc.) and extract local invariant descriptors (SIFT, SURF, etc.) from the two input images.
- Step #2: Match the descriptors between the two images.
- Step #3: Use the RANSAC algorithm to estimate a homography matrix using our matched feature vectors.
- Step #4: Apply a warping transformation using the homography matrix obtained from Step #3.
